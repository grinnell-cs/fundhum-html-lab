  Alice looked on with great interest as the King took an enormous memorandum-book out of his pocket, and began writing. A sudden thought struck her, and she took hold of the end of the pencil, which came some way over his shoulder, and began writing for him. 
</p>

<p>
  The poor King looked puzzled and unhappy, and struggled with the pencil for some time without saying anything; but Alice was too strong for him, and at last he panted out, <q class="king spoken">My dear! I really must get a thinner pencil. I can’t manage this one a bit; it writes all manner of things that I don’t intend—</q>
</p>

<p>
  <q class="queen spoken">What manner of things?</q> said the Queen, looking over the book (in which Alice had put <q class="alice written">The White Knight is sliding down the poker. He balances very badly</q>) <q class="queen spoken">That’s not a memorandum of <em>your</em> feelings!</q>
